/**
 * Single source of truth for the company's name, address and phone (NAP),
 * social profiles and canonical origin.
 *
 * These details were previously repeated across Footer, Contact, the assistant
 * knowledge base and index.html — nine copies of the same phone number, which
 * is exactly how a business ends up publishing a number it no longer answers.
 * Local SEO also penalises inconsistent NAP, so it has to come from one place.

/*
 * ─── BEFORE THIS SITE GOES LIVE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The five values marked REPLACE below are placeholders. They are sequential
 * dummy digits and they are wired into the footer, the contact page, the CTA
 * hotline, every `tel:` link, the WhatsApp deep link and the LocalBusiness
 * structured data — so until they are real, every conversion path on the site
 * reaches nobody.
 *
 * Also outstanding, and needing information only you have:
 *
 *   1. VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT — unset, so the enquiry form falls back to
 *      opening the visitor's mail client. On a phone that often does nothing
 *      at all. Point it at Formspree, Web3Forms, Basin or your own handler;
 *      the submit path, error state and honeypot are already written for it.
 *
 *   2. Project photography — the 26 images across the featured slider, both
 *      project listings and the five galleries are Unsplash stock, captioned
 *      with specific names, square footages and completion dates. Four real
 *      handovers will outperform nine invented ones, and they are the only
 *      thing on the page a prospect can verify.
 *
 *   3. A cost band for /whats-included — the page targets "house construction
 *      cost West Bengal" and contains no figure. One honest range, with a line
 *      on what moves it, is the difference between answering the visitor's
 *      question and sending them to a competitor.
 *
 *   4. Certification numbers — ISO 9001:2015, IGBC, BIS and CIDC are claimed
 *      on the About page with nothing to verify them against. Add the
 *      registration number under each, and remove any that are aspirational.
 *
 *   5. The About page story and team photographs — currently generic
 *      contractor-brochure copy and four sets of initials, on the page where a
 *      prospect decides whether to call.
