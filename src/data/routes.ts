/**
 * Every indexable route, and everything a search engine reads about it.
 *
 * This is the single source for each page's <title>, meta description,
 * canonical path, visible <h1>, breadcrumb trail and JSON-LD. Three consumers
 * read it, so they cannot drift apart:
 *
 *   - `<Seo route="…">` writes the head at runtime.
 *   - `scripts/gen-sitemap.mjs` writes public/sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
 *   - `scripts/prerender.mjs` stamps the same head, heading and JSON-LD into
 *     dist/<route>/index.html for crawlers that never run JavaScript.
 *
 * The two build scripts load this file through Vite, so it may import
 * anything the app can — but nothing here may touch the DOM.
 *
 * Writing rules, enforced by `validateRoutes()` at build time:
 *
 *   - `title` is the complete <title>, brand included, at most 60 characters.
 *     Past that Google truncates with an ellipsis, and the part it cuts is the
 *     brand. The search term goes first, the town next, the brand last.
 *   - `description` is 110–160 characters: long enough to be used verbatim
 *     rather than replaced with a scraped sentence, short enough not to be cut.
 *   - Every title and description is unique across the site. Two URLs with the
 *     same title compete with each other for the same query.
 *   - `heading` + `subheading` together are the page's one <h1>. The heading is
 *     the short label the design shows large; the subheading carries the search
 *     term so the h1 says what the page is about, in words a visitor can see.
