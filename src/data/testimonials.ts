/**
 * Client testimonials, in one place.
 *
 * These lived in two files with two different sets of words. Rajesh Mehta,
 * Priya Dutta and Amit Banerjee each appeared on the homepage carousel *and*
 * on /our-work/testimonials — with different job titles and completely
 * different quotes. Priya Dutta was "Director, Dutta & Associates" on one page
 * and "Business Owner" on the other; Amit Banerjee was a "Property Owner" and
 * a "Property Developer". A visitor who read the homepage and then followed
 * the link saw the same three people testify twice, differently, which is the
 * kind of detail that costs a contractor the enquiry.
 *
 * The homepage's versions won: they name the project, the town and a specific
 * outcome, where the testimonials page's were interchangeable praise.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `siteInfo.ts` — one copy, so the two surfaces cannot drift
 * apart again.
 *
 * NOTE FOR THE OWNER: these are marketing copy, not collected reviews. Before
 * adding `aggregateRating` or `review` structured data to the site, they need
 * to be genuine reviews gathered from real customers — Google's policy
 * requires it, and marking up invented ones risks a manual action against the
 * whole domain. See the note in index.html.
