/**
 * JSON-LD builders.
 *
 * Structured data is the one part of a page a search engine reads without
 * having to interpret anything, and it is what makes a result eligible for the
 * richer treatments — the sitelinks under a homepage result, the expandable
 * FAQ rows, the breadcrumb trail in place of a raw URL, the knowledge panel
 * that ties this domain to the company's social profiles.
 *
 * Everything here hangs off one `@id` graph rather than repeating the
 * organisation on every page:
 *
 *   {origin}/#organization  — the company (GeneralContractor)
 *   {origin}/#website       — the site itself
 *   {origin}/#localbusiness — the physical office
 *   {origin}{path}/#webpage — the page being viewed
 *
 * A page-level node then references the organisation by `@id` instead of
 * restating it, which is what tells Google these are one entity across
 * eighteen URLs rather than eighteen unrelated businesses.
 *
 * Nothing here may state a fact the site cannot back up. `aggregateRating` is
 * deliberately absent for the same reason it was removed from index.html: the
 * testimonials are marketing copy, not collected reviews, and fake rating
 * markup risks a manual action against the whole domain. Add it — with real
 * `review` items beside it — once reviews are genuinely being collected.
