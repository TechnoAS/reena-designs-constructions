          The homepage's crossed CONTACT US / FREE QUOTE tapes, pulled up so

          The negative margin lifts the ribbon by roughly half its own height,
          which puts the crossing point on the boundary itself — the tapes read
          as laid across the join between the two sections, which is what tape
          does.

          `flow-root` on the section is load-bearing. Without it this margin is
          adjoining the section's own top edge, so it collapses through and
          drags the whole navy block up with it — the ribbon never moves
          relative to the section and stays entirely inside the blue.
          `flow-root` makes the section a block formatting context, which stops
          the collapse without clipping anything.

          Nothing here may clip: no `overflow-hidden` on the section, or the
          half hanging over the white would be cut off. It paints over the
          section above simply by coming later in the document.
