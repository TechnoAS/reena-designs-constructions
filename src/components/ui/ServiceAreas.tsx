/**
 * Where the company works.
 *
 * This is the site's only piece of copy that names the towns individually, and
 * it is here for a specific reason. "Construction company in Midnapur" is one
 * query with a handful of serious competitors; "house construction in Belda",
 * "interior designer in Ghatal" and eighteen more like them are queries almost
 * nobody has written a page for. A search engine cannot return a page for a
 * town the page never mentions, so a firm that travels across the district and
 * says only "West Bengal" is invisible for every one of those searches.
 *
 * The block is deliberately plain text with real links rather than a decorative
 * map: the town names have to be in the rendered HTML to count, and each tile
 * links somewhere real so the section carries internal link weight instead of
 * being a dead keyword list. That distinction matters — a wall of place names
 * that links nowhere and says nothing is exactly the doorway-page pattern
 * Google penalises. Every name here is a place the company genuinely works.
 *
 * The natural next step, when there is time for it, is a real page per major
 * town (/areas/kharagpur and so on) carrying that town's own projects,
 * testimonials and travel notes. That outranks a shared block every time. This
 * section is the version that can ship today and still be honest.
